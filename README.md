# Flight_Booking_Management_System
he Flight Booking Management System is an airline reservation platform designed to streamline the process of searching, booking, and managing airline reservations. It employs an event-driven microservices architecture to transform and upgrade the conventional, monolithic airline booking systems. Leveraging the cloud-native paradigm, the airline booking solution breaks down the essential business logic into self-contained services such as Flight Inventory Services, Booking Services, and Notification Services, making it possible to develop and update the system in a fast, incremental, and flexible manner without having to redeploy the entire system. 

The backend is segmented into specialized services such as User & Identity, Flight Inventory, and Booking Services, all of which are managed by a central Spring Cloud Gateway. This architecture hides the complexity of the architecture from the frontend while maintaining strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) through JWT authentication, which ensures that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive operational data. Data integrity is maintained through a Layered Architecture and JPA persistence, which uses Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to ensure a clean separation between the database and the API contracts. 

The platform is designed to maintain high data integrity by employing a layered architecture and PostgreSQL for reliable data persistence The system will be developed using modern containerization standards to ensure that the software is stable and works well in all environments.   This project combines the complexities of travel with smart design to create a fast, secure, and friendly booking system.
